    "We analyzed the financial highlights of JPMorgan Chase by leveraging a multimodal language model. This process involves defining a set of questions related to the financial data extracted from a document, which includes details on net revenue, net income trends, per-share data, key ratios, balance sheet changes, market data, and employee information. The code is crafted to extract relevant information from the document and utilize the multimodal model to generate precise answers to these predefined questions. By combining structured data with sophisticated language processing, we gain valuable insights into JPMorgan Chase's financial performance."
